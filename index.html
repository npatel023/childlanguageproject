              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Becoming a new mother is scary in every way. From walking to talking, you’re always worrying. I aim to help new mothers more aware of how language development will work with their new babies, some background, what to expect, and some recommendations. One question that often pops into the mind of new mothers is, “How will my baby learn to talk to me?” The world of language development is vast and scary but knowing about how it develops in your baby will help you help your child get the most out of their ability to learn language. Just like getting to walking and running, language also has many components that eventually lead to full and coherent speech. Babies babble and gesture in order to communicate with their caregivers, those babbles slowly form into words and so the process begins.

              <div class="collapsible-header">Components of Language Development</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>There are components to language development that each child must master and learn in order to speak their language fluently. <br>Some components include: 
                  <br>
                    &#8226; Lexical Development (Word meaning) <br>
                    &#8226; Forming Speech <br>
                    &#8226; Speech Processing <br>
                    &#8226; Language Sounds <br>
                    &#8226; Accent<br>
                    &#8226; Grammar (Syntax)<br>
                    &#8226; Interpersonal Understanding<br></span></div>

              <div class="collapsible-header">Approaches to Language Development</div>
              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>There are various ways the development of language in children has been looked at by professionals. Chomsky thought his idea that we are innately born with a device in our brains that naturally acquires language was correct, however there are also cognitive and communicative approaches that famous child psychologist Piaget suggested. He thought that children went through cognitive stages and stated that what is absorbed at age two is crucial in healthy language development. One thing that stuck with me was what psychologist Tomasello claimed in his approach. He suggested that children are able to read intentions of others and find patterns in our speech which is crucial to their development. 
            <br><br>Even though there are many theories and approaches to how children acquire language, there is no definite answer.</span></div>

                <div class="collapsible-header">Speech Production</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Your child will make many sounds and gestures in an effort to communicate. This is known as pre-language. Your child will coo and laugh, babble, repeat what they hear and eventually produce their own individual first words.</span></div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="collapsible-header">Shared Intentionality and Gestures</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Even though your child cannot use coherent language to communicate with you, they understand more than we generally give them credit for. When you are your babbling infant or toddler are playing a game together or completing a task together, they know exactly what is happening. The amazing thing is that your children understand communication at the most basic level. They understand shared goals and often respond to a partner or playmate that is as engaged in the activity ad they are. 
                <br><br>Children respond positively and gain more out of an engaged parent. Doing this helps with the development of word learning and brain maturation. Fostering healthy joint activities with shared goals gives way to healthy communication habits in the future. I recommend that as a new mother you make sure to always show interest in whatever joint activity you are doing with your child because through you and your shared goals they are learning, comprehending and becoming language masters. 
                <br><br>Using your hands and movements to talk to your babies is an important component in their language development. They will use these physical cues to associate objects, people, and tasks to words. Repetition is key. For example, if you pointed to water every day to your child and said, “water”, that association would come easily to them eventually if you asked

                <div class="collapsible-header">First Words</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>No one is expecting your young child to go from making incoherent sounds straight to full words. Children have their own strategies they use to get to adult speech. They may use substitutions (with letters in words), they may try to assimilate their sounds into word sounds, or even speak in half words.
                <br><br>Something known as the “problem of word meaning” is known to show up. It is the fact that some words have an infinite amount of possible meanings. We can fix this issue by paying attention to social and context cues. Facial and verbal expressions are crucial.  Children will often mislabel objects, this is known as discrepant labeling.
                <br><br>Another thing to look at would be grouping or formally known as taxonomic assumption. It is perfectly normal for your child to group, let’s say, all furry things under the word “dog” or all flying things under the word “bird”.

                <div class="collapsible-header">How to Make Sure Your Child Gets the Most out of Language Development</div>
                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>If you’ve made it this far into my website, congratulations! You are now a pro in your child’s language development! Learning all of this information myself, has made me better adept and in tune with hoe to pay attention to the development of my own children in order to make sure they thrive.<br> 
                <br>Some recommendations I have for you to be language development super mom:<br> 
                        &#8226; INTERACT INTERACT INTERACT!! Interactions with your child literally shape their future! Engage them in order to foster healthy communication skills and so they know that you are interested in their world as well!<br>
                        &#8226;	Label things consistently for your children. Children learn by association and look to YOU for their foundation.<br>
                        &#8226;	Use your facial expressions and talk with your hands!! Point at things, gesture towards them, smile, frown, look surprised! Infants use these cues to gauge the mood and understand the context of what is happening around them.<br>
                        &#8226;	Keep their environment busy! Since children learn best from the world around them, their little brains are constantly processing and observing. By keeping them engaged with their environment, you will be boosting their brain for word learning and associations.<br>
                        &#8226;	The most important piece of advice I can offer you is- be patient. Everything is a learning experience for you and your baby together, tackling on a new world of things. Some may be slower learners than others, but the important thing is that all babies take their own time.<br></span></div>
